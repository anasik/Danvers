QUICKSITES
----------
A small PHP script, that aids one in building an almost static yet fairly dynamic website, when the requirements are lower than WordPress but higher than a bundle of html documents. 
The common elements, i.e. Branding, Nav, footer e.t.c. are loaded once while the individual page content is dynamically loaded from separate files stored in the 'pages' folder.

A certain page is accessible at example.com/?page=pageName. Which is the kind of URIs to be used in Links to other pages. So a page named about would be at example.com/?page=about. Also, the name at the end of this query and the name of the document containing the page's content have to be identical.
